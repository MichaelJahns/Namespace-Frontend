# Namespace
### Intention
* Keep my skills and technologies sharp
* Create an application that I myself would utilize in my DND games
* Create an RESTful API that will allow a future android app to use the same server
* Create a fluid flowing layout that keeps players thinking about their campaign
* Create tools that can help players and dungeon masters to think about their campaign in different ways
* Create for users an experience at adds to the table top doesnt substract from it
### Now A Restful API
A restart on my namespace personal project. my desire to have it available cross platform meant i needed to build an API and my ambitions to have my learn react lead me to start again

# Namespace

### Now A Restful API, Now Reactive
A restart on my namespace personal Spring boot Dungeons and Dragons augment project, originally made to help me keep track of the Herbology mini game my dungeon master made for me. 
My desire to build the same service cross platform meant i needed to build an API and my ambitions to have my learn react lead me to start wholly again

### Intention
* Create tools that can help players and dungeon masters to think about their campaign in different ways
* Create tools that can help players and dungeon masters break out of narrative slumps
* Create tools that can help players and dungeon masters keep track of important information and characters
* Create a fluid flowing layout that keeps players the players focus where it needs to be
* Create for users an experience that adds to the tabletop but doesnt distract from it
* Create an application that I myself would utilize in my DND games
* Keep my skills and technologies sharp

### Future Features(WIP)
~* conditionalRendering on signIn component~
* make a hamburger menu of "Account" in nav bar
* add firebase userAuth
~* login failure state messaging~
* user==null landing page explaining the what

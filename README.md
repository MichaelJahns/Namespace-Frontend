# Namespace

### Now A Restful API, Now Reactive
A restart on my namespace personal Spring boot Dungeons and Dragons augment project, originally made to help me keep track of the Herbology mini game my professor came up for us. 
My desire to have build the same service cross platform meant i needed to build an API and my ambitions to have my learn react lead me to start wholly again

### Intention
* Create tools that can help players and dungeon masters to think about their campaign in different ways
* Create tools that can help players and dungeon masters break out of narrative slumps, and keep track of important information
* Create a fluid flowing layout that keeps players the players focus where it needs to be
* Create for users an experience that adds to the tabletop but doesnt distract from it
* Create an application that I myself would utilize in my DND games
* Create an RESTful API that will allow a future android app to use the same server
* Keep my skills and technologies sharp

### Future Features(WIP)
* conditionalRendering on signIn component
* login failure state messaging
* user==null landing page explaining the what
* make a hamburger menu of "Account" in nav bar
